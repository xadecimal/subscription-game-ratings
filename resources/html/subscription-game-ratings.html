        <h1>Subscription Game Ratings</h1>
        <p>
            This page lists all current PS+ games that are part of the game catalog (extra and premium) and
            classics catalog (premium only) sorted by IGDB rating.
        </p>
        <p>
            It gets the current list of PS+ games from <a href=\"https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/all-ps-plus-games#all-ps-plus-extra-games-list\">Push Square</a>
            and for each one retrieves the IGDB total rating (critics + users) and user rating.
        </p>
        <p>
            The list is ranked by IGDB total rating, but also shows the Push Square score and user score along with the IGDB user rating.
        </p>
        <p>
            Game Pass console and PC games will also be added eventually.
